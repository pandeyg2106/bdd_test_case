An overview of the solution
===

We are in the process of defining and automating the user acceptance criterias for the Move file/folder functionality on the mobile client. It is a functionality that our users need and we have to make sure that it works according to our specification.

You can download the official reMarkable companion application on your phone (go into App Store or Play Store dependent on wether you have an IOS or Android phone). When asked to fill in a One Time Code use the following cridentials:

Username: qa.interview.remarkable@gmail.com

Password: SAND6tish7chis_spum

When the client is connected, you'll see the file structure that you need in order to solve this task. You can use this to better understand how the Move functionality is working. Feel free to experiment as much as you want with the Move functionality.

Some bugs I found while writing the tests
